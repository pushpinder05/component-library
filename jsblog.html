                <p>The Mosaic web browser was released in 1993. As the first browser with a graphical user interface
                    accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent
                    World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released
                    a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. Navigator quickly became the most used
                    browser.</p>
                <p>During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for
                    dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web
                    development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting
                    language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems
                    to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.
                </p>
                <p>Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with
                    syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages. Although the new
                    language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a
                    Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in
                    December. Eich claims that HyperTalk syntax and handler names influenced JavaScript.</p>
                <p>The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java.
                    Since Java was the hot new programming language at the time, this has been characterized as a
                    marketing ploy by Netscape to give its own new language cachet.</p>
